                    Iâ€™m a UX designer with a mind for making experiences seamless, beautiful, and enjoyable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background is in visual arts and music, with an education in design and web development. This unconventional combination inspires me to look beyond the obvious. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Design and candid conversations have great potential to solve seemingly impossible problems. My goal is to apply my knowledge to solving these solutions, and ultimately helping to shape a better (and smarter) future.
